# April Fools - Do you need Glasses?

Hey all. This is a simple chrome extension I made to mess with friends and coworkers. It should affect all websites and will blur most if not all of the elements on the page making the user either think they need glasses, get pissed off at you, or think their internet is broken and annoy the hell out of IT.

**_Two methods to installing the extension if you are unfamliar._**

**The first Method:** _To enjoy the extension as is_

1. Go to [chrome://extensions/]
2. Drag and Drop the file *NeedGlasses-Source.crx* on to the page
3. Click Add and Enjoy


**The Second Method:** _if you would like to edit the extention_

1. Edit the source code as you like.
  ⋅⋅* The stylesheet is located in NeedGlasses-Source > src > inject > inject.css
2. Go to [chrome://extensions/]
2. Make sure Developer Mode it turned on (Check box at the top)
3. Click Load Unpacked Extension
4. Select newly edited code directory
5. Enjoy

Have fun messing with people.

*p.s. If you edit the css selectors stay away from using the universal selector*
`*`
*This will seriously bog down chrome to the point of unusability.*

**I am not liable for any harm or stress this may causes your computers or loved ones. Beware of headaches... Shits annoying.**
